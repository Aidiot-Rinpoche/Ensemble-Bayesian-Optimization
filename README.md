# Ensemble-Bayesian-Optimization
This is the MATLAB code repository associated with the paper [_Ensemble Bayesian Optimization_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01445.pdf). We propose a new batch/distributed Bayesian optimization technique called **Ensemble Bayesian Optimization**, which unprecedentedly scales up Bayesian optimization both in terms of input dimensions and observation size. Please refer to the paper if you need more details on the algorithm.
